          <p class="description"><strong>Military animals</strong> are trained animals that are used in warfare and other combat related activities. As working animals, different military animals serve different functions. Horses, elephants, camels, and other animals have been used for both <u>transportation</u> and <u>mounted attack</u>. Pigeons were used for <u>communication</u> and <u>photographic espionage</u>. Many other animals have been reportedly used in various <u>specialized military functions</u>, including rats and pigs. Dogs have long been employed in a wide variety of military purposes, more recently focusing on <u>guarding</u> and <u>bomb detection</u>, and along with dolphins and sea lions are in active use today.</p>
